## Rules of the Task 

These are the golden rules you are expected to follow. We will **NOT** accept any submissions if these guidelines are not followed.

- Fork this Repository to your Github account and Clone it to your local machine.
- Make a new branch in your repository and switch to this branch using command line. (Hint:Search for `git checkout`)
- Write a draft, create new stuff, make changes, make it beautiful and save these changes locally.
- After finishing your assignment, push back the code to your fork and make a pull request back to this original repository.
- If your pull request is merged, you already know what that means, right?
- Keep working on the assignment after your first pull request (optional) and if you want, open another pull request to further improve your submission. 
- Do the task yourself.

## Let's Begin!

Welcome again! Before we start,we really appreciate it when things get done before the deadline.So take the cue.

Alright then, to complete this task, you will be building **Club Hub** with the following functionalities:

- Before User Authentication:
  - `Home Page` User Authentication: SignIn via BITS University Email.
  - (Bonus): Add a Navigation Bar with the items being `Club Hub Logo` of Club Hub at the left and `Home` next to it.
  
- After User Authentication:
  - Items displayed on the navbar should change to `Club Hub Logo`, `Home` on the left side and `User Profile` on the right.
  - `Home Page` should display a Feed with Posts listed in reverse chronological order. (Not the same login page again)
  - Include a NEW POST/ COMPOSE button on the `Home Page` to add new posts.
  - `Home Page`: For each post in the feed, include:
    - Author Name
    - Post Content
    - Like button functionality
    - comment functionality
    - (Bonus) Author Image
    - (Bonus) Ability to delete posts and comments
    - (Bonus) Ability to search for posts based on keywords
  - `User Profile`: A page displaying general information like username, image, recent posts, total number of posts etc. 
    - Add a Logout button
    - (Bonus) After authentication, instead of `User Profile`, the username should be displayed on the right side of navbar. (for instance, `coderjedi` will be displayed instead of `User Profile` if the username is `coderjedi`)
    
- [Optional] Use your frontend skills, if you have any, to make it look better.
